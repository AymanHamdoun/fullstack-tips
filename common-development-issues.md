# Common Development Issues

This document aims to help in solving common issues you might encounter during the actual development process of a web application. To avoid re inventing the wheel, I will only focus on issues which I think are hard to understand not because of their complexity, but rather because the articles explaining them are either way too long and pretentious or simply hard to find.

You might have worked on APIs or frontend applications before, But now your doing both and trying to get your web app to talk to your API. I remember when using jQuery's ajax methods years ago CORS issues never happened, but times change and the tech world gets off on making your life harder than it should be, so what the hell is CORS and how can I quickly get on to continuing my app.
